I live with my +fianc√©e+ wife and partner in all things, Caitria, and our small
dog, Curie. In 2014 we started [[http://pocketknife.io][Pocketknife Design and Engineering]], a software
contracting company. In late 2016 I co-founded [[http://localhost:8123/blog/2018/11/23/working-at-healthtensor/][HealthTensor]].
