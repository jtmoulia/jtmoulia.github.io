I live in South Lake Tahoe (the Nevada side) with my [[http://overthemoon2015.com][fiancee]], Caitria,
and dog, Curie.

I recently read and loved [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12074927-the-fractal-prince][The Fractal Prince]] -- it's turtles all the
way down.

* Spatch

  I work with the fine folk at [[http://spatch.co/][Spatch]] on designing and implementing
  the backend for a modern, decentralized communication system.

  Interesting parts of the job have been working with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation][operational transform]],
  decentralized systems, and [[http://elixir-lang.org/][Elixir]].
