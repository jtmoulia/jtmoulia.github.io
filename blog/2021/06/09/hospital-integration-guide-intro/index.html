Building a clinical app <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> and getting healthcare providers
on-board is hard. This guide should help.
</p>

<p>
In this series you&rsquo;ll learn how to compose a healthcare application out of
familiar, modern web technologies: patients / physicians authenticate via
<b>OAuth</b>, clinical data is fetched as <b>JSON</b> over a <b>RESTful API</b>, and you can
deliver an <b>HTML5</b> user-interface.
</p>

<p>
As for why: this is the guide I wish I&rsquo;d had when my company, <a href="https://www.healthtensor.com/">HealthTensor</a>, set
out to build a digital health app for hospitals back in 2017. We had
experience developing web and mobile apps, but a clinical app? Back then we had
no idea where to even begin and as a result our first hospital integration took
well over a year to complete. Fast-forward several years to 2021: with a better
understanding of the process we can now integrate with new hospitals in well
under a month.

<h4 id="orgeb1934e">Contents</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgeb1934e">
<p>
This guide is organized as a series of four posts, each of which walks through a
component of building a clinical app. The content is targeted at early-stage
clinical application developers and integration managers, or for anyone curious
about developing an application for healthcare providers.
</p>

<p>
<b>insert image of overview here</b>
</p>

<p>
Below is an overview of the parts; each will be linked to as it&rsquo;s written.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgede2f1e" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="orgede2f1e">Part 1: Building a relationship with the health provider and EHR</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgede2f1e">
<p>
For your app to be used, the first step is to develop a relationship with a
healthcare provider and their electronic health record (EHR)<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> so you can
deliver your application physicians. This is both the least technical and most
difficult part of going from zero-to-one with a hospital app because that you
need to take a demo or idea to a healthcare provider and prove value. Once the
provider is onboard they&rsquo;ll require you to complete a security
review<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> and have a plan for testing and deploying
application. In parallel to completing the healthcare provider&rsquo;s requirements
you can register your application with the EHR&rsquo;s SMART platform and work through
their security review.
</p>

<p>
Part 1 covers developing the clinical relationship and planning the timeline.
<b>Note:</b> Part 1 will be linked here when available.

<div id="outline-container-org2b95248" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org2b95248">Part 2: The application platform: SMART on FHIR</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org2b95248">
<p>
Next I&rsquo;ll explain how to work with <a href="https://docs.smarthealthit.org/">SMART on FHIR</a><sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> to handle the
technical side of clinical integration. We&rsquo;ll work through how to register your
application with the EHR, authenticate on behalf of patients or physicians
(OAuth), and fetch clinical data (JSON over a RESTful API). By the end of this
part you should understand what it takes to build a backend-only hospital
application.
</p>

<p>
Part 2 covers how to use SMART on FHIR for authentication and clinical data fetching.
<b>Note:</b> Part 2 will be linked here when available.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5e1a9df" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org5e1a9df">Part 3: Developing a web-application in the EHR</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org5e1a9df">
<p>
The third part covers how to deliver a user-interface to a patient or physician.
As a composable web-based standard SMART on FHIR allows you to build your
front-end using any technology which can speak HTTP, e.g. web, mobile, and
desktop apps are possible. I&rsquo;ll specifically explain how to build a web-app for
healthcare practitioners that can be loaded from a patient&rsquo;s record in the EHR
at the point-of-care.
</p>

<p>
Part 3 explores building a user-interface for clinical apps. <b>Note:</b> Part 3 will
be linked here when available.

<div id="outline-container-org4b29ae1" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org4b29ae1">Part 4: Getting the most out of clinical integrations</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org4b29ae1">
<p>
In the final part of the series you&rsquo;ll see how to get the most out of a hospital
integration. As a new standard SMART on FHIR still has some rough edges for
common workflows. It lacks &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; for new clinical data, bulk data fetching,
and complex queries across multiple references. I don&rsquo;t have clean solutions,
but I can offer some workarounds with their tradeoffs.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately there are solutions to these issues in the works. Developing
technologies like <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/sandbox">CDS hooks</a>, <a href="https://smarthealthit.org/smart-hl7-bulk-data-access-flat-fhir/">SMART/HL7 bulk data access</a>, and a <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/graphql.html">GraphQL API</a> will
fill in the gaps, and each continues the trend of leveraging industry-standards
to solve real problems with clinical integration.
</p>

<p>
Part 4 gets into shortcomings with SMART on FHIR, how to overcome them, and
developing standards. <b>Note:</b> Part 4 will be linked here when available.

<div id="outline-container-orge79bbfa" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orge79bbfa">Conclusion</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge79bbfa">
<p>
For many reasons, some of them good, the healthcare industry is hard to build
for. New standards have drastically lowered the technical bar to contribution,
and I hope this guide has helped you understand what tools are available. That
being said, I&rsquo;ll leave the business, medical, security, and bureaucratic
challenges up to you.

<h2 class="footnotes">Footnotes: </h2>
<div id="text-footnotes">

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.1" class="footnum" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
The term <b>clinical app</b> covers a huge range of products and
requirements. I&rsquo;ll focus on developing software applications that 1) are
web-based, 2) requires up-to-date clinical data, and 3) are used by healthcare
practitioners at the point-of-care in hospitals. This likely won&rsquo;t fit your
exact requirements but is super customizable. For example, the front-end might
be implemented as a desktop or mobile application. Or, patients can authenticate
you to access data on their behalf instead of healthcare practitioners.
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.2" class="footnum" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
The <b>Electronic Health Record</b> (EHR) is the system of record for a
hopsital&rsquo;s digital data and the platform clinical workflows are built on. While
SMART on FHIR is specified as a standard, it&rsquo;s implemented, hosted, and managed
on the hospital&rsquo;s behalf by the individual EHRs. In other words, the EHRs are
key stakeholders throughout clinical integration. More on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record">wikipedia</a>.
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.3" class="footnum" href="#fnr.3">3</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
While <b>security</b> isn&rsquo;t emphasized in this introduction,
it&rsquo;s an absolutely critical component of clinical integration. From a business
and legal perspective your stack must comply to <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html">HIPAA</a> as well as any additional
requirements set by the healthcare provider. Fall short of that you are legally
liable for breaches and no one will do business with you. More importantly, from
an ethical perspective you are being entrusted with individuals&rsquo; private
information and are responsible for protecting that information. I&rsquo;ll touch on
this more in Part 1, but HIPAA compliance is a massive topic that is better
covered elsewhere.
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.4" class="footnum" href="#fnr.4">4</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
<b>SMART on FHIR</b> is a relatively young but disruptive
healthcare standard designed to facilitate building clinical applications. Since
its inception at Brigham-Young in 2010 it&rsquo;s grown into a standard supported by
all major EHRs. Apple&rsquo;s HealthKit, for example, uses SMART on FHIR to give
patients access to their clinical information.
