#+DESCRIPTION: Frying Pan, by Berry & Hog

Caitria and I put together a song, Frying Pan -- it's a spaghetti-western-esque
piece about a desert rose and her hero.

Caitria wrote, sang, and played most of the instruments; I hit record and
twiddled the knobs. We recorded and arranged the piece using Reaper.
