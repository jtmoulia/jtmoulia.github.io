#+DESCRIPTION: Life in the Loin, by Berry & Hog

I've been figuring how to produce music to tak advantage of Caitria's musical
savantry. I'll leave the attempts on this site to keep a log.

As for the context of the song: Caitria has been haunted by a mosquito in our
SF Tenderloin studio. I'm thankful the mosquito finds me distasteful.
