#+DESCRIPTION: On contract with Norse, IPViking attack map visualization

[[file:../assets/img/norse-map.gif]] linked from [[http://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/watch-the-endless-global-cyberwar-in-real-time#2dsddi2][buzzfeed]]

I was hired by the [[http://www.norse-corp.com/][Norse Corporation]] to create a visualization that
demo'd the rich stream of threat data underlying their IPViking
product. I worked with Norse and their [[http://d3.artzub.com/wbca/][initial]] [[http://map.honeycloud.net][inspiration]] to decide
on the style of visualization, and how the salient dimensions of time,
location, and service could be explored. The result was the improved
[[http://www.norse-corp.com/blog-thursday-140320.html][Live Attack Map]].

* Building It

  The visualization is built using `d3.js` to handle data to code
  mappings and consistency. It draws to an HTML canvas. I wrote all of
  the code in HTML, CSS, and javascript, except for the generation of
  the particle. This approach of using d3 to draw particles to an html
  canvas was inspired by [[http://d3.artzub.com][ArtZub's]] [[http://d3.artzub.com/wbca/][visualization]].

  Mouse-over interactions are used to highlight an interesting
  attribute of the underlying data, particularly threats targeting a
  country, originating from a country, and made over a particular
  service.

  The sliding tick marks at the bottom left of the screen are my
  favorite part: they're an attempt to provide a window into timing
  patterns 10-90s scale. However, at the moment tick marks overlap
  preventing it from showing more than 1 attack per application
  "tick".

  As part of the contract we decided to not make the initial version
  responsive to different display sizes, so it does have some issues
  with tables overlapping.
