#+DESCRIPTION: A reference for the Reaper DAW

[[https://www.reaper.fm/][Reaper]] is an excellent digital audio workstation, but it's often bafflingly
complex. This page is a living reference of resoureces I've found useful for
working with Reaper.

* Plugins

** Megababy Sequencer

The MegaBaby sequencer that comes with Reaper is stupidly flexible.

** Keyzone Classic Piano (VST)

The [[http://www.vst4free.com/free_vst.php?id=2848][Keyzone Classic]] piano contains samples for five pianos:

- **Keyzone 1**
- **Yamaha Grand Piano**
- **Steinway Grand Piano** this piano sounds deep and rich
- **Basic Electric Piano** an atmospheric, slow attack organ-like feel
- **Rhodes Piano**

** Helm Synthesizer

[[https://tytel.org/helm/][Helm]] is a beautifully designed, cross-platform, open-source synthesizer.
Importantly for synth novices like me, it comes with an enormous array of
presets that lets you quickly try out new sounds. The audio produced is high
quality, and can be tailored to the production.

One nitpick: the UI is large on my 13" MBP. Expanding the plugin out of the
plugin list view gives helm a bit more space to breathe.
