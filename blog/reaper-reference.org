#+DESCRIPTION: A reference for the Reaper DAW

[[https://www.reaper.fm/][Reaper]] is an excellent digital audio workstation, but it's often bafflingly
complex. This page is a living reference of resoureces I've found useful for
working with Reaper.

* Plugins

** Megababy Sequencer

The MegaBaby sequencer that comes with Reaper is stupidly flexible.

** Keyzone Classic Piano (VST)

The [[http://www.vst4free.com/free_vst.php?id=2848][Keyzone Classic]] piano contains samples for five pianos:

- **Keyzone 1**
- **Yamaha Grand Piano**
- **Steinway Grand Piano** this piano sounds deep and rich
- **Basic Electric Piano** an atmospheric, slow attack organ-like feel
- **Rhodes Piano**
