#+DESCRIPTION: Some food recipes.

A collection of food recipes.

* Breadmaker

** Fluffy and Sweet

   Large white loaf

   - 1 1/4 cup of body temp water
   - 2 tbs oil
   - 2 tbs honey
   - 1 1/2 tsp yeast
   - 3 1/4 cup flour
   - 2 tsp salt
   - 1 tsp vital wheat gluten (to make it fluffy)

* Pickles
** Salt + Vinegar Hot Pickled Cukes

   Best way to figure this out is mix up a picklin juice that tastes like the
   pickles you want.

   Then boil the juice, and add it to a jar packed with veggies.

   Harder veggies [carrots!] can be par-boiled first.

   First cut used much salt and a bit less white vinegar.

   Ideas for mix-ins:

   - Mustard seeds (crushed?)
   - Dill
   - Crushed peppers
   - Chopped garlic
   - Jalapenos

* Granola
** Basic

   1. Mix granola + nut + berry shit [dry]
   2. Separately mix maple syrup [2?] egg white, vanilla to taste [wet]
   3. Keep dry stuff moist with wet stuff
   4. Bake @ 250℉ until it starts to brown
   5. Crack door + turn off oven
   6. Leave until super crispy

* Baked Veggies
** Roasted Broccoli / Cauliflower / Brussel Sprouts

- Preheat oven to 400℉ for crispy
- Chop down veggies
- Spread veggies across cooking pan
- Sprinkle with oil & flavor, e.g.
  - salt & pepper
  - vinegar (balsamic, rice)
  - soy sauce
  - hot sauce
  - ?
- Bake until just crispy, or to your taste

** Eggplant Parmesan

- 3 eggplant, thinly sliced
- 16oz mozzarella (shred)
- 1/2 cup grated parmesan
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 4 cups breadcrumbs

Bake until the top has that golden fried cheese look. It takes longer than I'd
expected to get the eggplant cooked all the way through.

* Sauces

** Roux

Equal parts flour and fat, mix with water and continuously stir over low heat
until completely smooth.

Awesome pie filler.

complex. This page is a living reference of resoureces I've found useful for
working with Reaper.
