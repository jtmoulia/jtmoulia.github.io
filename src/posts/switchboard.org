#+DESCRIPTION: Switchboard: An IMAP connection manager [Spatch]

[[file:../assets/img/switchboard_by_spatch.png]]

I developed [[http://switchboard.spatch.co][Switchboard]] with [[http://spatch.co][Spatch]] to provide their mobile
application with real-time push notifications and processing.

* What is it?

  Switchboard provides high level tools for managing IMAP clients across
  email accounts and providers:

  - Manages the lifecycle of IMAP processes, and handles error conditions;
  - Provides an API allowing workers to process emails as they arrive;
  - Handles the boilerplate of IMAP connection management and monitoring for new emails.

  Switchboard frees you from the plumbing of server-side email handling,
  allowing you to focus on your products and services.
